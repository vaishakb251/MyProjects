IRIS Deep Learning Model

This project explores the application of deep learning to classify the famous IRIS dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers' features. Using a neural network, the model predicts the species of an iris flower based on sepal and petal dimensions.

A. Project Details

1. Dataset
    Name: IRIS Dataset
    Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
    Features:
        Sepal Length (cm)
        Sepal Width (cm)
        Petal Length (cm)
        Petal Width (cm)
    Target Classes:
        Setosa
        Versicolor
        Virginica

2. Implementation
The project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook (iris_deep_learning_model.ipynb) to:

    Load and preprocess the IRIS dataset.
    Build a deep learning model using Keras/TensorFlow.
    Train and evaluate the model.
    Visualize the model's performance metrics.
