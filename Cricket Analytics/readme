# Cricket Analytics: Batting Performance Analysis & Prediction

This repository contains an R-based project that analyzes cricket batting performance data using various statistical techniques, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression modeling, and country-based analysis. The project also predicts batting averages using a regression model and visualizes performance trends over time.

## Project Overview

The **Cricket Analytics** project leverages data from international cricket batsmen to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on key batting performance metrics (e.g., batting average, strike rate).
- Build predictive models for batting performance, utilizing techniques like **Multiple Linear Regression**.
- Analyze and visualize batting trends across different countries.
- Predict batting averages using statistical models.
  
This analysis can help understand batting performance trends, identify top players, and offer insights into cricket analytics.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, renames columns, and processes player statistics (e.g., batting average, strike rate).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Calculates and visualizes key statistics, including distribution of centuries, fifties, ducks, and other performance metrics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explores correlations between various performance metrics like runs, strike rate, batting average, and others.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Builds predictive models to estimate batting average based on historical performance data.
- **Country-Based Analysis**: Analyzes and visualizes cricket player distributions across the globe.
- **Performance Over Time**: Analyzes trends in batting average and strike rate over the years.
- **Visualization**: Provides interactive tables and visualizations for better insights using `ggplot2` and `DT`.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaishakb251/MyProjects.git

2. Install the required R packages:
    install.packages(c("readxl", "dplyr", "knitr", "DT", "corrplot", "ggplot2", "sf", "maps", "leaps", "olsrr"))

3. Open the R script (cricket_analytics.R) and run the code in your RStudio environment or any other R platform.

File Structure

    cricket_analytics.R: The main R script that performs data cleaning, exploration, modeling, and visualization.
    Batsman.xlsx: Dataset containing international batsmen's performance data (ensure the file path is correctly set when running the code).
    README.md: This README file, containing project details and setup instructions.

Data Source

The dataset used in this project is ICC Cricket Data from Kaggle. This data contains performance metrics of international batsmen, including:

    Matches played
    Innings
    Runs scored
    Batting average
    Strike rate
    Hundreds, fifties, ducks, and more.

Usage

    Data Cleaning:
        Converts numeric columns to appropriate types.
        Handles missing values represented by "-" and removes rows with missing data.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Summary statistics of key metrics.
        Frequency distribution of centuries, fifties, and ducks.
        Correlation matrix to identify relationships between performance metrics.
    Predictive Modeling:
        Multiple Linear Regression models are built to predict batting averages based on historical performance metrics.
    Country-Based Analysis:
        Analyzes and visualizes cricket player distribution by country on a world map.
    Performance Over Time:
        Creates a performance overview across different years and visualizes trends in batting average and strike rate.
